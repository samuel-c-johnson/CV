## Skills

#### Excellent Communication Skills

Having worked as a dive instructor and a field scientist I have developed sound communications skills. It has been essential in my previous employment working in potentially dangerous environemnts, with good
communication I have managed to ensure safety andmanage risk.
As a dive instructor it was paramount that I convey the importance of certain skills and behaviours not only to ensure safety but also to relate to often nervous clients.
In Madagascar working as a field scientist I was in charge of large groups of volunteers in an extremely remote environment. Communication was key in order to educate and inform about potential dangers
and to make sure everyone was alright.

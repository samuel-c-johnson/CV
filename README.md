## Your Name

After spending 4 years working abroad I felt the need for a new challenge and having been interested in computer science for some time I chose to take on programming. Although early days, I really being able 
to build up something from scratch, it can be the most frustrating thing in the world but there's no greater feeling than getting it a program to work.

I have just completed the precourse and about to start 12 weeks intensive training at Makers Academy. When I've completed the course I would like to work for an environmentally minded organisation being able to use tech
to improve conservation.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Skills

#### Excellent Communication Skills

Having worked as a dive instructor and a field scientist I have developed sound communications skills. It has been essential in my previous employment working in potentially dangerous environemnts, with good
communication I have managed to ensure safety andmanage risk.
As a dive instructor it was paramount that I convey the importance of certain skills and behaviours not only to ensure safety but also to relate to often nervous clients.
In Madagascar working as a field scientist I was in charge of large groups of volunteers in an extremely remote environment. Communication was key in order to educate and inform about potential dangers
and to make sure everyone was alright.

## About Me
A full-stack developer with a history in marine science. Highly
adaptable with sound problem solving abilities developed through working in remote areas with little resources in a results based industry. Recently graduated from a highly selective coding academy with a broad skill set and hunger to create. Being a scientist I was intrigued by how things function and this interest is what inspired me to become a developer.
I'm looking for a position in an innovative and productive environment where I can build on my skill set and grow with a company.

## Skills

#### Collaborator

Through my previous experience working in the field, I have learnt the value of working well as a group. I have a deep understanding of the importance of the soft-skills such as communication, conflict management, trust and leadership that are required to function as an effective team.


#### Driven

I enjoy being out of my comfort zone and taking on new challenges. After University I bought a one way ticket to the Dominican Republic in order to learn a new language and develop a new skill (dive instructor) to improve my employability as a marine biologist.

#### Adaptable

Whether it is working in a foreign country or building a full-stack app in a new language in 2 weeks, I can adapt to the task at hand. My time abroad has taught me to deal with unforeseen problems and how to find the suitable solutions. At Makers Academy we 'learn to learn' and it was through this process that I have been able to adapt to working in new languages so quickly.

## About Me
A full-stack developer with a history in marine science. Recently graduated from a highly selective coding academy with a broad skill set and hunger to create. Being a scientist I was intrigued by how things function and this interest is what inspired me to become a developer.
I'm looking for a position in an innovative and productive environment where I can build on my skill set and grow with a company.

## Skills

#### Excellent Communication Skills

Having worked as a dive instructor and a field scientist I have developed sound communications skills. It has been essential in my previous employment working in potentially dangerous environments, with good
communication I have managed to ensure safety and manage risk.
As a dive instructor it was paramount that I convey the importance of certain skills and behaviours not only to ensure safety but also to relate to often nervous clients.
In Madagascar working as a field scientist I was in charge of large groups of volunteers in an extremely remote environment. Communication was key in order to educate and inform about potential dangers
and to make sure everyone was alright.
